# projecteuler
daily js challenges to enhance problem solving

Typescript files can be run with ts-node

## Install depencencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Run a program
``` bash
tsx filename
```

Decided to stop with project euler challenges since they are more in line with data science. Daily problems will now focus on more typical software engineer challenges.
